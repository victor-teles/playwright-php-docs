Locators are the central piece of Playwright's auto-waiting and retry-ability. In a nutshell, locators represent a way to find element(s) on the page at any moment.

## Basic Locators

### Locate by title

```php
$element = $page->getByTitle('My Page Title');
```

### Locate label

```php
$element = $page->getByLabel('My Label');
```

### Locate by placeholder

```php
$element = $page->getByPlaceholder('My Placeholder');

$element->fill('My New Value');
```
