description: Run PlaywrightPHP tests in a remote browser
---

To run PlaywrightPHP tests with a remote browser, you can use the `connectOverCDP` method.

```php
$playwright = new Playwright();
$browser = $playwright->connectOverCDP(['wsEndpoint' => 'http://127.0.0.1:9222']);
$page = $browser->newPage();

$page->goto('https://example.com');
```

## Chrome DevTools Protocol

You can start a cdpSession to communicate with Chrome DevTools Protocol, and send commands and listen to events.

### Sending commands

```php
$cdpSession = $page->context()->newCDPSession($page);

$cdpSession->send('Animation.enable');
```

### Listening to events

```php
$cdpSession->on('Animation.onAnimationCanceled', new JsFunction([$eventData], '
    echo "Animation canceled: " . $eventData['id'] . PHP_EOL;
'));
```
